NOTE: In this project i hav faced a problem which was weird to me. after connecting to mongodb atlas everything was going fine. like i could sand data to server and can use data from server. but after a while a mongo error occurred. data was not sanding to database. data aren't loading to my route. on my route there showing an error which is "Mongo error" nothing mone. on server code the error type is "Topology is closed, please connect"
