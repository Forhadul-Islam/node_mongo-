NOTE: In this project i have faced a problem which was weird to me. after connecting to mongodb atlas everything was going fine. like i could sand data to server and can use data from server. but after a while a mongo error occurred. data was not sanding to database. data aren't loading to my route. on my route there showing an error which is "Mongo error" nothing mone. on server code the error type is "Topology is closed, please connect"

SOLUTION: Okay i found the solution for the problem. when i set the IP address 00.00.00 at mongodb Atlas the problem was gone away forever........ because IP address changes.. so after a while the current IP address does not match to the IP address set to the mongodb cluster.. so the connection between the local machine and database does not exists. That's why the problem began..
